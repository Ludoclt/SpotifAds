## What is SpotifAds ?

SpotfAds is an ads blocker proxy for Spotify, it blocks ads requests made by Spotify. This is a small, very light program that can run in background in the taskbar and start automatically when Windows starts up if the option is enabled.

- It can be installed from [here](https://github.com/Ludoclt/SpotifAds/releases)

## How does it work ?

1. **Proxy Port**
- Allows you to change the port on which the proxy is connected

2. **Proxy Switch**
- Allows you to enable or disable the proxy

3. **Startup Switch**
- Allows you to enable or disable the automatic start of the application when Windows starts up

4. **Taskbar Switch**
- Allows you to enable or disable the execution of the application in the background in the taskbar when it is closed

## Additional Notes

- The application requires .NET 5, but if the installation setup worked correctly and if you agreed to install it when asked to do so you don't have to worry about it, otherwise install it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0)

- I deliberately prevent the execution of the application if it is not installed in the user folder to avoid problems with automatic start or installation of certificates. So please use the default directory location in the installation setup

- Again to avoid issues, please don't run the app as administrator for the same reasons mentioned above

- If you have any problems, please [contact me](https://github.com/Ludoclt)
